        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a technologist, and I have spent my entire career in the software development world.  My undergraduate years had a focus on writing code for robotics.  Not long after graduation I went back to school to learn how to build video games.  Making video games was my dream job, and I was fortunate to do that for the first few years of my professional career.  It was unexpected, but I took an opportunity outside of games where I learned how to build enterprise desktop applications.</p>
        <p>During this time I started to dabble in leadership. I was exposed to the proper execution of agile development practices, and it forever changed the way I approach software development.  The next phase of my career moved me back into engineering, but this time it was for web development.  It was the right time and right place to make the change.  Web applications were finding its stride in the market, and technologies like Docker were becoming huge drivers for the cloud.  I found my niche in the front-end space, and over time I grew back into management.</p>
        <p>I'm a lifelong learner.  My latest fascinations have been driving me to gain better insights into how business work and how to be a better leader.  Once again, I found myself back in school, but this time it was to earn an MBA.  I'm passionate about driving technology in business, and I truly love helping others achieve their dreams within technology.</p>
        <p>When I am not working, I spend my time with my wife and children. It's the little things I enjoy most; like doing sidewalk chalk art, playing video games, helping my wife achieve her dreams. At the age of 7, my oldest child was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.  Now I take opportunities to help others that struggle with T1D.  Whether it's contributing to our local JDRF chapter, or developing software to support those with T1D, I look forward to the day that Type 1 Diabetes is cured.</p>

        <p>This site is a place for me to document my musings, interest, and challenges. I tend to think of it as a journal more than anything else.  The content I write about won't be for everyone, but I hope there are things some people find useful.  </p>
